# Kaggle: Home Credit Default Competition

Can you predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan?

Many people plan to get loans, and many of them struggle to get sone due to insufficient or poor credit histories, and they are often misled to untrustworthy lenders. In this competition, Home Credit, thriving to help that population build a positive and safe loan experience, asks data science practitioners to predict which of the clients have the capability of repaying their loans. This project, upon the implementation of machine learning, will allow clients to be provided loans with a principal, maturity, and a repayment calendar that will empower them.
